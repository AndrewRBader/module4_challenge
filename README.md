# module4_challenge
Andrew Bader's Module 4 Challenge Submission for CU Fintech Bootcamp

In this challenge, I evaluated four new investment options for inclusion in a client's portfolio. I determined the investment potential of these funds based on risk-management metrics including the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas.

Technologies used: Jupyter Notebook, Python, Panda, and Numpy
